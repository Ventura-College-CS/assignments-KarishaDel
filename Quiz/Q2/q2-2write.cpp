/*WRITE.CPP: The first mistake I made was that I had put the struct under the StudentsBin function. 
Once I fixed that I took similar steps as assignments 1 and 2-4. Since I was using the ptr pointer 
I had to change all of s. to ptr and since it was a dynamic memory I had to use the +i so it would 
run thru the entire text file. The next part stumped me on how to get the information to be copied into the bin file. 
I was not allocating enough memory but I was able to fix that on line 57 
by using the sizeof(Students) which is the struct.Â */
